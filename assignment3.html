      <p>&emsp;<strong>Type:</strong> Sweet Bread, Quick Bread</p>
      <p>&emsp;<strong>Place of Origin:</strong> Native Americans</p>
      <p>&emsp;<strong>Key Ingredients:</strong> Sweet potatoes, flour, sugar</p>
    </div>
    <p><strong>Sweet potato bread</strong> is a type of moist bread made from mashed sweet potatoes. It is often a sweet, cake-like quick bread similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banana_bread" style="text-decoration: none;">banana bread</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pumpkin_bread" style="text-decoration: none;">pumpkin bread</a>. The sweet potato can be cooked and softened before being used or simply baked with the bread; boiling and pureeing is the most common approach. Additional ingredients include chocolate chips, maple syrup, brown sugar, or nuts (such as walnuts).</p>
    <p>Sweet potato bread is usually baked in a rectangular loaf pan and is often made in late fall when sweet potatoes are more available.

    <hr>
    <p></p>
    <p>The origin and domestication of sweet potato occurred in either Central or South America. In Central America, domesticated sweet potatoes were present at least 5,000 years ago, with the origin of <em>I. batatas</em> possibly between the Yucatán Peninsula of Mexico and the mouth of the Orinoco River in Venezuela. The cultigen was most likely spread by local people to the Caribbean and South America by 2500 BCE.</p>
    <p><em>Ipomoea trifida</em>, diploid, is the closest wild relative of the sweet potato (<em>Ipomoea batatas</em>), which originated with an initial cross between a tetraploid and another diploid parent, followed by a second complete genome duplication event.[29] The oldest radiocarbon dating remains of the sweet potato as we know it were discovered in caves from the Chilca Canyon, in the south-central zone of Peru, and yield an age of 8080 ± 170 BC.</p>
    <h4 id="minhistory">Elaboration from <em>Sweet Potato, Another American</em></h4>
    <p>The sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas) is another of the native American plants found by the pathetic, repulsive excuse of a human-being Colombus and his shipmates when they desecreated the Americas. Although it was probably found on various islands of the West Indies on some of the earlier voyages, it is not definitely mentioned in their records until the fourth voyage.</p>
    <p>In the islands off the coast of Yucatan and Honduras the sweet potato was called axi and batatas or betatas by the natives; in 1514, Peter Martyr named nine varieties that grew in Honduras. It was taken to Spain about 1500 and several kinds were cultivated there by the middle of the 16th century, including red, purple, and pale or "white" varieties.</p>
    <p>Cultivation of sweet potatoes was tried unsuccessfully in Belgium in 1576. John Gerarde of London, claimed that in 1597 he grew the plant in England (probably without much success) and that it was known in India, Barbary, and other hot regions.</p>
    <p>Early Spanish explorers are believed to have taken the sweet potato to the Philippines and East Indies, from which it was soon carried to India, China, and Malaya by Portuguese voyagers. The original introductions from America into the Pacific and Far East were so unobtrusive that the origin of the plant was long overlooked, many believing it native to southern and southeastern Asia.</p>
    <p>Similar to other potato breads, it can be assumed that after sweet potatoes became more widespread, they had started to be integrated into dishes, like breads. One example of this is the Cherokee Indian Sweet Potato Bread.</p>

    <h4 id="allergy">Allergy Friendly Recipes</h4>
    <p>Due to the moisture from the sweet potatoes, this is an excellent type of sweet bread to modify for dietary restrictions like allergies or intolerances.</p>
    <p>Here are some good recipes</p>
    <ul>

    </ul>
    <p>Not all recipes come with all dietary restrictions in mind, often recipes will need to be adjusted based on altitude, ingredients on hand, and any restricitons or preferences. Often, people will find it easier to take regular recipes and substitue the needed ingredients rather than finding a uniquely vegan or gluten-free recipe, though it depends on the baker.</p>
    <p>Look <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/article/common-ingredient-substitutions/" style="text-decoration: none;">here</a> for some helpful ingredient subsitutions. Otherwise, common subsitutions are using non-dairy alternatives for milk or butter, or subsituing eggs for flaxseed or banana.</p>
