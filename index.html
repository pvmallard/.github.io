    <h3>My name is <u><em>Mallory Prescott</em> (she/her)</u></h3>
    <p>My goals for this course are maybe to figure out how to make a nice website!</p>
    <h6>Or at least pass with a good grade and a bit of html knowledge</h6>
    <p>I am a transfer student from the University of Denver and I'm double majoring in comp sci and CTD.</p>
    <p>My body hates me and vice versa but I like to bake, puzzle, perform <strong><em>poorly</em></strong> in video games, and pretend I'm not procrastinating.</p>
    <a href="img/smile-good.jpg">ah yes a picture of me</a>
    <h6>The picture you'll see is tiny me, the only me I appretiate. Below, I hope you find something enjoyable.</h6>
